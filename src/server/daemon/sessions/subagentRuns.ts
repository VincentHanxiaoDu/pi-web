/**
 * Subagent-tool runs, read from the layout the tool leaves behind.
 *
 * A run is not a session, which is why none of this shows up anywhere else in
 * the UI: the agent sessions directory lists `*.jsonl` files at its top level,
 * and a subagent run writes into subdirectories instead -
 *
 *   <sessionDir>/<parentSessionId>/<runId>/run-N/session.jsonl   (live)
 *   <sessionDir>/subagent-artifacts/<runId>_<agent>_<n>_meta.json (finished)
 *
 * A child that runs in a fork of the parent context is the exception: it writes
 * its transcript to <sessionDir>/<parentSessionId>/forks/<timestamp>_<id>.jsonl
 * and leaves its own run directory empty until it finishes. Nothing in that
 * file names the run it belongs to - the header carries only the parent
 * session's path, and its `session_info` name is the parent's name - so such a
 * run is reported from its directory alone and shows the generic agent name
 * until an artifact lands. That is worth it: the alternative was being absent
 * from the list for the whole time it was working.
 *
 * Attribution is by recorded fact, never by timing. Two records exist: a run
 * directory under <sessionDir>/<parentSessionFile>/, and the spawn the parent
 * wrote into its own transcript. The shared artifacts directory records no
 * owner at all, so it supplies detail about runs this session already owns and
 * never membership - see `runIdsNamedByParent` for the measurements.
 *
 * So the parent conversation could not say what its children were doing, or
 * even that it had any. Reading the directory is deliberate rather than
 * subscribing to the tool: the tool is an extension that may not be installed,
 * its runs outlive the turn that started them, and the files are what survives
 * a server restart.
 */

/**
 * How long a run with no artifact may stay silent before it is presumed gone,
 * when nothing better is known.
 *
 * Only a fallback: a child writes its transcript when it calls a tool, and a
 * reviewer reading a long document can think for far longer than this between
 * calls. Judging liveness by file mtime alone therefore declared exactly the
 * runs worth watching - the slow, careful ones - dead. Whether the parent turn
 * is still running is a fact rather than a guess, so it wins when available.

/**
 * Why membership comes from the run directory and from nothing else.
 *
 * A subagent's result returns to the session that started it and to no other,
 * so which session a run belongs to is a fact fixed when it is spawned. The
 * only place that fact is written down is the run directory's location:
 * <sessionDir>/<parentSessionFile>/<runId>/, created under the parent that
 * started it.
 *
 * The artifacts directory records nothing about it. Read across all 53
 * transcripts and 50 `meta.json` files of one real project: `meta.json` carries
 * runId, agent, a `cwd` that is the whole project and a `transcriptPath`
 * pointing back into the artifacts directory, and the transcript records carry
 * runId, agent, childIndex, cwd - no session or parent field in any of them.
 * The directory is shared by every session in the project, so an artifact alone
 * cannot say whose run it is.
 *
 * A liveness window was tried here and was wrong by construction: it treated "a
 * transcript is being appended to right now" as "this belongs to whoever is
 * asking", so while any one session's child streamed, every session that listed
 * claimed it. The owner saw two sessions show a running ring at once and a
 * session with no children of its own report "1 background run". The evidence
 * that seemed to justify it - no foreign runs claimed - had been measured while
 * no foreign run was live, which is the one condition under which the bug
 * cannot appear.
 *
 * There is a second record, and it is what a fork-context child leaves: the
 * parent's own transcript. When its agent spawns a run, the `subagent` tool's
 * result is written into the parent's session file naming the run id
 * ("Async: worker [<runId>]"), so the parent has written down which runs are
 * its own. Measured across one project's eight session files, the 18 runs with
 * no directory of their own each appeared in exactly one parent, none in two -
 * and the run ids named by the two parents that spawn subagents did not
 * overlap. This is the same shape background tasks already use, where the
 * registry directory supplies state and the transcript supplies ownership.
 *
 * So a run neither of those records claims is not listed here. It is not hidden
 * work: it is another session's work, and it is listed there.
